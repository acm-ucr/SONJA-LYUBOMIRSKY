        human happiness{" "}
      </span>
      . Why is the scientific study of happiness important? In short, because
      most people believe that happiness is meaningful, desirable, and an
      important, worthy goal, because happiness is one of the most salient and
      significant dimensions of human experience and emotional life, because
      happiness yields numerous rewards for the individual, and because it makes
      for a better, healthier, stronger society.

      <br />
      Along these lines, my current research addresses three critical questions:
      <br />
      <ol className="list-decimal ml-8">
        <li>What makes people happy?</li>
        <li>Is happiness a good thing?</li>
        <li>
          How and why can people learn to lead happier and more flourishing
          lives?

        Why Are Some People Happier Than Others?
      </p>
      I have always been struck by the capacity of some individuals to be
      remarkably happy, even in the face of stress, trauma, or adversity. Thus,
      my earlier research efforts had focused on trying to understand why some
      people are happier than others (for a review and theoretical framework,
      see Lyubomirsky, 2001). To this end, my approach had been to explore the
      cognitive and motivational processes that distinguish individuals who show
      exceptionally high and low levels of happiness. These processes include
      social comparison (how people compare themselves to peers), dissonance
      reduction (how people justify both trivial and important choices in their
      lives), self-evaluation (how people judge themselves), person perception
      (how people think about others), and dwelling or rumination. My students
      and I have found that truly happy individuals construe life events and
      daily situations in ways that seem to maintain their happiness, while
      unhappy individuals construe experiences in ways that seem to reinforce
      unhappiness (e.g., Liberman, Boehm, Lyubomirsky, & Ross, 2009;
      Lyubomirsky, Layous, Chancellor, & Nelson, 2015; Lyubomirsky & Ross, 1997,
      1999; see also Boehm, Ruberton, & Lyubomirsky, 2021).
      <br /> <br />
      To cast our work on happiness in a broader framework, we have also been
      exploring the meaning, expression, and pursuit of happiness across
      cultures, subcultures, and age groups. For example, despite media reports,
      we have found that parents actually experience more happiness and meaning
      than do non-parents–both when evaluating their lives as a whole, when
      going about their days, and when caring for their children (versus doing
      other activities; Nelson, Kushlev, English, Dunn, & Lyubomirsky, 2013). Of
      course, parents’ happiness is impacted by myriad factors, including their
      age and SES and their children’s ages and temperaments (Nelson,
      Killingsworth, Layous, Cole, & Lyubomirsky, 2019; Nelson, Kushlev, &
      Lyubomirsky, 2014). Furthermore, we have carried out happiness-increasing
      interventions among Japanese engineers, Korean and Hong Kong
      undergraduates, Spanish, French, and German professionals, Canadian
      elementary school students, and British and U.S. teens (for a few of our
      cross-cultural findings, see Boehm et al., 2011; Layous et al., 2013;
      Sheldon et al., 2017; Shin & Lyubomirsky, 2017; Shin et al., 2020; Shin et
      al., 2021).
